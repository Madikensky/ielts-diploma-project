    "text": "How the mind ages\n\nThe way mental function changes is largely determined by three factors - mental lifestyle, the impact of chronic disease and flexibility of the mind. Some of these factors are within our control, while others are not.\n\nAccording to Bahrick, 'the long-term residue of knowledge remains stable over the decades, independent of the age of the person and the memory.'\n\nPerhaps even more important than the ability to remember is the ability to manage memory - a mental function known as metamemory. 'You could say metamemory is a byproduct of going to school,' says psychologist Robert Kail of Purdue University, 'The question-and-answer process, especially exam taking, helps children learn and teaches them how their memory functions. This may be one reason why the better educated a person is, the more likely they are to perform well in many aspects of life and in psychological assessments: A group of adult novice chess players were compared with a group of child experts at the game. But when asked to remember the patterns of chess pieces arranged on a board, the children won.' Because they'd played a lot of chess, their knowledge of chess was better organized than that of the adults, and their existing knowledge of chess served as a framework for new memory,' explains Kail.\n\nCognitive style, another factor in maintaining mental function, is what Schaie calls the ability to adapt and roll with life's punches. 'He measured mental flexibility with questions and tests requiring people to carry out in an offbeat way an everyday activity they had done millions of times. One example was asking people to copy a paragraph substituting uppercase letters for lowercase ones. These tests seem silly, but flexible-minded people manage to complete them,' says Schaie. The rigid person responds with tension instead and performs poorly. 'Those who score highly on tests of cognition at an advanced age are those who tested high in mental flexibility at middle age'.\n\nOn a more optimistic note, one mental resource that only improves with time is specialized knowledge. Crystallized intelligence about one's occupation apparently does not decline at all until at least age 75. Vocabulary is another such specialized form of knowledge. Research clearly shows that vocabulary develops with time. Retired teachers and journalists consistently score higher on tests of vocabulary and general information than college students.",

    "text": "Ensuring our future food supply\n\nClimate change and new diseases threaten the limited varieties of seeds we depend on for food. Luckily, we still have many of the seeds used in the past - but we must take steps to save them.\n\nSix miles outside the town of Decorah, Iowa in the USA, an 890-acre stretch of rolling fields and woods called Heritage Farm is letting its crops go to seed. Everything about Heritage Farm is in stark contrast to the surrounding acres of intensively farmed fields of corn and soybean that are typical of modern agriculture. Heritage Farm is devoted to collecting rather than growing seeds. It is home to the Seed Savers Exchange, one of the largest non government-owned seed banks in the United States.\n\nIn 1975 Diane Ott Whealy was given the seedlings of two plant varieties that her great grandfather had brought to America from Bavaria in 1870: Grandpa Ott's morning glory and his German Pink tomato. Wanting to preserve similar traditional varieties, known as heirloom plants, Diane and her husband, Kent, decided to establish a place where the seeds of the past could be kept and traded. The exchange now has more than 13,000 members, and the many thousands of heirloom varieties they have donated are kept in its walk-in coolers, freezers, and root cellars the seeds of many thousands of heirloom varieties and, as you walk around an old red barn that is covered in Grandpa Ott's beautiful morning glory blossoms, you come across the different vegetables, herbs, and flowers they have planted there.\n\n\"Each year our members list their seeds in this,\" Diane Ott Whealy says, handing over a copy of the Seed Savers Exchange 2010 Yearbook. It is as thick as a big-city telephone directory, with page after page of exotic beans, garlic, potatoes, peppers, apples, pears, and plums - each with its own name and personal history. For example, there's an Estonian Yellow Cherry tomato, which was brought to the seed bank by 'an elderly Russian lady' who lived in Tallinn, and a Persian Star garlic from 'a bazaar in Samarkand.' There's also a bean donated by archaeologists searching for pygmy elephant fossils in New Mexico.\n\nFood variety extinction is happening all over the world - and it's happening fast. In the United States an estimated 90 percent of historic fruit and vegetable varieties are no longer grown. Of the 7,000 different apple varieties that were grown in the 1800s, fewer than a hundred remain. Experts estimate that in total we have lost more than 50 percent of the world's food varieties over the past century.\n\nWhy is this a problem? Because if disease or future climate change affects one of the handful of plants we've come to depend on to feed our growing planet, we might desperately need one of those varieties we've let become extinct.",

    "text": "The fluoridation controversy\n\nThe long-standing debate about whether to fluoridate our drinking water continues. Fluoridation is the addition of fluorine to public water supplies with the aim of reducing tooth decay. \n\nThe fluorine, when mixed with water, becomes fluoride and the desired concentration of fluoride in public water is approximately one part per million, depending on the regional temperature and hence the amount of water people are likely to drink. Many studies, such as those by McClure in 1970 through to Burt in 1983, have shown that when children drink fluoridated water, their average rate of tooth decay seems greatly reduced. A typical figure claimed is 50 percent reduction. This apparently enormous benefit for children's teeth is the major argument in favor of fluoridation.\n\nAn understanding of the fluoridation issue has important implications. If, according to the experts, fluoridation is unquestionably a beneficial and non-hazardous measure, then the wisdom of allowing the public to vote on, and reject it must be questioned.\n\nKuhn (1970) argued that scientific knowledge does not always develop as an orderly process, but is characterized by periodic revolutions. in which the methods of study and the assessment criteria change in a fragmented way. According to Kuhn, the shift from one scientific way of thinking to another is not made solely on the basis of clear rules of formal scientific practice, but can include social factors.\n\nBoth arguments consider the scientific evidence concerning fluoridation, but differ in their assessments of the social benefits and costs. This difference is not between rationality and irrationality but is a legitimate difference in values.",
